This module will recursively scan the current directory, looking for supported project types. After selecting which projects you'd like to run, it will execute them all simultaneously, perfect for those multi-tiered projects!

## Installation:

```sh
npm i -g @jimmyboh/playbook
```

## Usage:

_Coming Soon!_

## Features:
 - Auto-scans filesystem for projects.
 - Supports multiple project types (`dotnet`, `node`, `npm` tasks, and growing).
 - Interactive REPL for advanced editing, or direct commands for quick access.
